## Reading Assignment Week #3 

The Off the Grid and Back Again article stood out with its framing around vehicular use and the shift of how cities are ordered and what this means as it is represented through data. 
It is interesting to place this in the context of Los Angeles that is so predicated on vehicular use and had a very solid grid pattern that orients movement in the City. The article is keen on highlighting the role of planners given this historic emphasis on vehicle use and calls to action how planners can move towards more sustainable models. *How can transportation planners, plan for a future that is decades or even centuries ahead?* This article also sparked how suburbia can be redesigned and "retrofitted" to fit these future goals. Street design has played a key role in how data is organized into tracts and it is telling how this is the same model we use to gather census data as well. This piece makes it clear that t is up to planners to understand how development and modern planning practices have had a direct impact on street design to either make street networks more disconnected or more connected and as a result less car dependent and more sustainable. As planners move away from a sprawl approach to planning, including more walkable approaches to design can allow planners to return to a grid system that makes more a more connected grid system.
