## Reading Assignment Week #3 

The Off the Grid and Back Again article stood out with its framing around vehicular use and the shift of how cities are ordered and what this means as it is represented through data. 
It is interesting to place this in the context of Los Angeles that is so predicated on vehicular use and had a very solid grid pattern that orients movement in the City. The article is keen on highlighting the role of planners given this historic emphasis on vehicle use and calls to action how planners can move towards more sustainable models. *How can transportation planners, plan for a future that is decades or even centuries ahead?* This article also sparked how suburbia can be redesigned and "retrofitted" to fit these future goals. Street design has played a key role in how data is organized into tracts and it is telling how this is the same model we use to gather census data as well. This piece makes it clear that t is up to planners to understand how development and modern planning practices have had a direct impact on street design to either make street networks more disconnected or more connected and as a result less car dependent and more sustainable. As planners move away from a sprawl approach to planning, including more walkable approaches to design can allow planners to return to a grid system that makes more a more connected grid system. 

##### OSMnx

This piece reinforces the points from the Off the Grid article as it reminds planners how the grid system is a manifestation of a well connected City. Given the case sstudies provided, it is clear that suburban areas like Irvine, utilize street design as a way to reduce connectivity between neighbors and intentionally create deadends for privacy and in turn take up more space. This reinforces the notion of the single family home and how it is a housing typology that create division in communities and shuts communities off from one another. The specific tool that the article highlights (OSMx) will OSMnx  allow researchers and practitioners to increase their abilities to manipulate data in a way that is more user friendly and creates access to street networks all over the world. As easy as it is to use this program to acquire information on urban street networks, the tool is limited in that it is unable to tell the user about the quality of the pedestrian environment or quality of the streetscape, and does not have much data available from developing countries. *How can planners use OSMnx in a manner that also highlights the social and political conexts of the neighborhoods that it is representing through data?*
