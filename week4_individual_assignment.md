## Thoughts on Ben Welsh Keynote Event

###### At the mapathon, I attended the keynote with Ben Welsh who is the editor of the Data and Graphics Department at the LA Times. This department is a team of reporters and computer programmers who collect, organize, analyze and present large amounts of information who have various backgrounds with data analysis and visualization. The goal of the team is to create digital journalism important to readers through data, development, and design. 

###### Ben was a very dynamic speaker who was able to break down how his department serves the purpose of any newspaper to generate income from subscriptions and advertising but also to report news in a way that is reflective of the needs of its audience. He was also able to provide insight into how the department is organized and how the overall evolution of the LA Times has reflected a shift to digital media (over 50% of readers are from mobile phones). Ben used the metaphor of the “assembly line” to demonstrate this cultural shift away from traditional print newspaper with headlines supplemented with photos to one that has grown to have visuals and graphics as standalone products. The goal of the department is to take raw materials and turn them into news products that are able to make sense of the world. 


###### **Ben divided his department’s approach into three categories (assembly lines):**
* Applications: Utilizes applications, software, websites to gather and refine data to serve a digital audience. This approach mines data from the ground up to create a web application such as the CoronaVirus Tracke or Wildfire Maps, or Election reports that generates data from a predefined model that stays updated and supports writers to represent data as quickly as possible. 

* Visual stories: An emerging story type that uses visual coverage that can stand alone and is pitched by a graphics reporter. One example is the Kobe crash earlier this year that tracked key locations of the crash and created a narrative from the graphics that could stand alone. One interesting point was the approach to aggregate and help compare police use of force during the George Floyd protests to the actual standards for police use of force they are supposed to follow (videos to tell a story but not maps that still fall under visual story and not graphics story). 

* Digital designs: Using digital design skills to elevate stories developed by other departments-- seen as boutique web designers of the newsroom. One example was the approach to combine many stories of the Chicano Moratorium to be a visual storytelling tool.

###### _The approach to utilize graphics and data from a journalism perspective demonstrates that by creating systems to pull data, a different narrative might be uncovered once the data becomes analyzed (Ex. Hurricane Harvey). Further, this approach can create a mechanism to back up nuanced findings with data in a way that can continue to grow and answer more research questions. One of my biggest takeaways from this conversation was that there are many layers to answering one research question and that you can layer your own findings and research question on top of a pre-existing one. For instance -- creating a gentrification index can have one basic layer of property values over time, but also introduce a component that measures commercial tenancy in a specific neighborhood and further continue to redefine gentrification from a modern context._
