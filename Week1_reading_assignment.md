<h3> A TERNER CENTER POLICY BRIEF - JULY 2020 
Single-Family Zoning Reform: An Analysis of SB 1120
<h6> This report talks about the implications that Senate Bill 1120 would have on the State of California. This bill would significantly impact single family neighborhoods by allowing single family lots to have up to four units on each lot. It would by allow this in two ways. The first way would be to allow existing single-family homes to be converted into duplexes. The proposed legislation would also allow single-family parcels to be subdivided into two lots and allow for a new, two-unit building to be constructed on the newly formed lot.The policy brief uses data to reinforce its arguments and contextualize the current status of single family neighborhoods in California. For example, "Per the Terner Centerâ€™s 2018 California Residential Land Use Survey, 66.8 percent of jurisdictions across the state have over 50 percent of their land zoned for single-family residential development." Further, the methodology that the research institute uses various datasets including the county tax assessor database and the U.S. Census Bureau to parse out eligible single family parcels in the State of California that would be affected by this policy -- highlight that over 1.2 million new homes are able to be constructed due to this legislation.
