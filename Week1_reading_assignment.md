<h3> A TERNER CENTER POLICY BRIEF - JULY 2020 
Single-Family Zoning Reform: An Analysis of SB 1120
<h6> This report talks about the implications that Senate Bill 1120 would have on the State of California. This bill would significantly impact single family neighborhoods by allowing single family lots to have up to four units on each lot. It would by allow this in two ways. The first way would be to allow existing single-family homes to be converted into duplexes. The proposed legislation would also allow single-family parcels to be subdivided into two lots and allow for a new, two-unit building to be constructed on the newly formed lot.The policy brief uses data to reinforce its arguments and contextualize the current status of single family neighborhoods in California. For example, "Per the Terner Centerâ€™s 2018 California Residential Land Use Survey, 66.8 percent of jurisdictions across the state have over 50 percent of their land zoned for single-family residential development." Further, the methodology that the research institute uses various datasets including the county tax assessor database and the U.S. Census Bureau to parse out eligible single family parcels in the State of California that would be affected by this policy -- highlight that over 1.2 million new homes are able to be constructed due to this legislation. The policy brief does highlight some shortfalls of this bill including the power of homeowner associations and the limitations of size restrictions but overall supports the passing of this bill as necessary to assuage the State's housing crisis. 
  
  <h6>This article spoke to me in regards to my approach to research and data because the researchers leveraged data to carry their message forward. Many times in housing debates, there are many emotions that enter into dialogue that are valid yet unsubstantiated with data. I appreciated the way that the researcher was able to give concrete numbers of how many single family parcels would be eligible under this legislation and its further cross referencing on the size of each parcel. I also apprreciate how the article highlights the changes that recent accessory dweling unit development was able to bring to the State, as a reference point to what can be possible. Highlighting the success of other cities like Portland and Minneapolis also demonstrates that other data sets can provide a precedent for what can happen in California.
