<h1>About Me
  <h6>My name is Alejandro Gonzalez and I am a second year student in urban planning with a concentration in design and development. My research interests lie at the intersection of housing, design, and equitable development. Specifically, I am interested in how urban design and housing development can create more opportunities for communities to stay in their neighborhoods. 
  
  <h1>Data Science Project :houses: </h1>
  <h6>For my data science project, I am going to consider the context of Los Angeles and California as predominantly single family areas. I hope to research the relationship between single family housing and homeownership to understand the makeup of single family homeowners and explore how density can be pushed to create more opportunities for ownership. California has had many density bills fail in recent years due to the lack of political will of single family homeowners. Within these discussions, alliances are formed between typical "NIMBYs" and low-income renters and low-income homeowners. Is there an argument that can be made in favor of density that would support more opportunities for homeownership? What would that density look like and where is it feasible?
