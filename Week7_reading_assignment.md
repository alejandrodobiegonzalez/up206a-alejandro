## Reading Assignment: The value of residential streets

##### _In this reading, the author Adam Millard-Ball develops an economic framework to understand the value of residential streets. His research reveals the thinking behind street design and how a shift can be made to value streets less and as a result create more housing. The author argues that little consideration is placed on the value of the underlying land when considering street widths/_

##### Initial Thoughts: I have worked on housing projects where it is the developer's responsibility to "give up" developeable land to dedicate to streets and always wondered why this mechanism existed when the priority should be more housing. I agree that streets are valuable land that can be used to create more housing rather than be used to prioritize car usage. I also agree that simply repurposing sidewalks or adding parklets still maintains the status quo and does not go in to change the underlying priority that cars get. It is also interesting that Millard-Ball points out that costs and benefits accrue almost exclusively to neighborhood residents where streets have little activity. This mechamisn therefore empowers single family homeowners more and indirectly adds economic value to them in the form of street value. As if single family homeowners needed another reason to deny density in their neighborhoods! This reading connects deeply with my own research topic that focuses on density and the mechanisms in place that might stop neighborhoods from densifying.

##### I applaud the writer for calling out urbanists in that they do not do enough to change the systems that prioritize car usage. As he mentions in his article, focusing on parking is not 

I conclude that planners should relax street width standards in subdivision regulations, especially where land costs are high—or even eliminate standards and leave it to developers to balance the allocation of land between streets and other uses.

 I go beyond quantifying the amount of land devoted to streets and estimate the valueof that landand its opportunity cost, which in turn informs the normative question of howwide streets should be.

from reading:

The planning and design discourse, however, has largely focused on how to divide up agivenquantity of land between competing uses—that is, how to allocate afixed street right-of-way.Less attention, either normatively or empirically, has been paid to how much urban land is or should be devoted to streets. The tradeoff between land for streets and land for other urban uses—parks, housing, commerce, public facilities, and so on—is implicit or ignored altogether

I focus on the street rights-of-way that furnish the long-term skeleton of a city, rather than off-street parking that can more easily convert to alternative land uses. I go beyond quantifying the amount of land devoted to streets and estimate the valueof that landand its opportunity cost, which in turn informs the normative question of howwide streets should be. I consider the question, “how wide should a street be,” from an economic standpoint, rather than the engineering and urban design perspectives that dominate the street design literature. 

I conclude that planners should relax street width standards in subdivision regulations, especially where land costs are high—or even eliminate standards and leave it to developers to balance the allocation of land between streets and other uses.

Conclusion:

The analysis in this papersuggests that in many U.S.cities, residential streets are too wideand too much land is devoted to the street right-of-way. Particularly in high-cost West Coast counties, housing costs are inflated, densities constrained, and overall social welfare reduced because too much land is devoted to streets
instead of housing. U.S. streets are exceptionally wide by international comparison and from the perspective of urban economics.

In many respects, however, these analyses have been too conservative: they have vigorously questioned the allocation of a fixed right-of-way width, but done little to challenge the overall amount of urban land that is devoted to streets. With few exceptions (Guo and Schloeter 2013; Manville 2017), the question of “how much land should be devoted to streets” has attracted little attention outside of theoretical treatments in urban economics.Street design manuals ignore the simple economic prescription that the more valuable the urban land, the narrower a street should be.


# Questions

* How can a system like parking credits / parking reductions be introduced to incentivize using more street space as housing?
* Is it possible to change the Bureau of Engineering (BOE) mechanism in the City of Los Angeles that determines how highway dedications are allotted by real estate developers for housing projects?
