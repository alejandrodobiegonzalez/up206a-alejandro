### Reading Assignment: The value of residential streets

###### In this reading, the author Adam Millard-Ball develops an economic framework to understand the value of residential streets. His research reveals the thinking behind street design and how a shift can be made to value streets less and as a result create more housing. The author argues that little consideration is placed on the value of the underlying land when considering street widths.

Initial Thoughts: I have worked on housing projects where it is the developer's responsibility to "give up" developeable land to dedicate to streets and always wondered why this mechanism existed. I agree that streets are valuable land that can be used to create more housing rather than prioritizing car usage. It is also interesting that Millard-Ball points out that costs and benefits accrue almost exclusively to neighborhood residents where streets have little activity. This mechamisn therefore empowers single family homeowners more and indirectly adds economic value to them in the form of street value.
