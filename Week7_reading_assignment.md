## Reading Assignment: The Value of Residential Streets

_In this reading, the author Adam Millard-Ball develops an economic framework to understand the value of residential streets. His research reveals the thinking behind street design and how a shift can be made to value streets less and as a result create more housing. The author argues that little consideration is placed on the value of the underlying land when considering street widths._

## Initial Thoughts: 
* I have worked on housing projects where it is the developer's responsibility to "give up" developeable land to dedicate to streets and always wondered why this mechanism existed when the priority should be more housing. 
* I agree that streets are valuable land that can be used to create more housing rather than be used to prioritize car usage. I also agree that simply repurposing sidewalks or adding parklets still maintains the status quo and does not go in to change the underlying priority that cars get. 
*It is also interesting that Millard-Ball points out that costs and benefits accrue almost exclusively to neighborhood residents where streets have little activity. This mechamisn therefore empowers single family homeowners more and indirectly adds economic value to them in the form of street value. As if single family homeowners needed another reason to deny density in their neighborhoods! This reading connects deeply with my own research topic that focuses on density and the mechanisms in place that might stop neighborhoods from densifying. 

## Reaction

I applaud the writer for calling out urbanists in that they do not do enough to change the systems that prioritize car usage and for putting a call to action for planners to relax street widths. As he mentions in his article, focusing on parking and using other measures to quantify how much land is being used by cars is not enough to understand the economic value of streets in urban areas. Further, by estimating the value of land and its "opportunity cost" the writer creates a framework to further understand how wide streets should actually be. Millard-Ball concludes that residential streets are too wide and that too much land in residential streets in U.S. cities is devoted to street right-of-way -- specifically calling out West Coast counties with LA being the second highest. Streets are a crucial component of land value that is not typically considered when looking at housing development and housing costs. This reading demonstrated a different perspective to question the allocation of urban land that is dedicated to streets. Many street rules are untouched while the argument that there is not enough land to build housing on continues. I also appreciate how Millard-Ball grounds his research in the historical context of federal standards that emerged in the 1930s specifying a minimum 50-foot right-of-way for residential streets in order to qualify for Federal Housing Administration mortgage guarantees. According to his research, by the 1990s, cities typically required a width of between 50 and 60 feet, that in turn mirrored specifications recommended by the Institute of Transportation Engineers in 1967. Another important point that the writer brings up is the argument of street parking avaiability and value. In an example that he cites in the City of San Francisco, where overnight curbside occupancy approaches 100%, many residents are converting their garages into accessory dwelling units (ADUs) that further combats the important of housing over parking and demonstrates that parking is a suboptimal use of land.

## Questions

* How can a system like parking credits / parking reductions be introduced to incentivize using more street space as housing?
* Is it possible to change the Bureau of Engineering (BOE) mechanism in the City of Los Angeles that determines how highway dedications are allotted by real estate developers for housing projects?
* Can you speak further to how accessory dwelling units (ADUs) in urban areas can be used to demonstrate how parking and streets are not an optimal use of land?
